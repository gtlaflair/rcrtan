This package contains functions for criterion-referenced test and item analysis. 

## Test Analysis: Dependability

The functions below can be used to examine the dependability of _single administration_ CRT assessments. 

### subkoviak

The `subkoviak` function follows @subkoviak1988practitioner's single administration procedures for estimating $\kappa$ and *p~o~*. To use the `subkoviak` function the data can come in one of two forms:

1. A dataframe of dichotomously scored items
2. A dataframe of total (raw) scores on the test. This also requires the analyst/researcher to know how many (dichotomous) items were on the test.

In both situations, the analyst/researcher needs to know the raw cut score of the test.

The procedure uses two pieces of information to estimate $\kappa$ and *p~o~*. They are a reliability coefficient (estimated in this function using Kuder-Richardson 20 or 21) and a standardized cut-score, which is estimated following @subkoviak1988practitioner. The estimated $\alpha$ coefficient and standardized cut-score are used to look up the values for $\kappa$ and *p~o~* in look up tables, which the function will return if `look_up = TRUE`

$$ z = \frac{c - 0.5 - M}{S}$$

where:

- _z_ = The standardized cut-score
- _c_ = The raw cut-score of the test
- _M_ =  The mean raw total score of the test
- _S_ = The standard deviation of the raw total scores of the test

# Analyze the dichomous data. Use look_up = TRUE if you want to see the look up tables from Subkoviak (1988).
sub_ex_one <- subkoviak(data = test_data, items = 2:11, raw_cut_score = 8)
```

The output from the analysis contains five variables.

1. _z_: The actual estimated standardized cut-score 
2. *z_rounded*: The rounded standardized cut-score used in the table look up
3. *KR_est*: The estimated alpha coefficient using one the Kuder-Richardson methods
4. *agree_coef.r_0.4*: The estimated agreement (*p~o~*) coefficient 
5. *kappa_coef.r_0.4*: The estimated kappa ($\kappa$) coefficient

```{r}
sub_ex_one
```

#### Examples: Without item information

When item-level information is not available the _items_ argument takes the number of dichotomous items on the test, and the _total_ argument takes the name of the column in the dataframe with the total score.

```{r}
sub_ex_two <- subkoviak(data = test_data, items = 10, raw_cut_score = 8, total = "Total")

sub_ex_two
```

### phi_domain

The `phi_domain` function calculates @brown1988short short-cut estimate of the generalizability coefficient ($\phi$ dependability) for absolute decisions.

```{r}
# When item level information is known
phi_d_one <- phi_domain(data = test_data, items = 2:11)

# When only total scores and number of items on the test are known
phi_d_two <- phi_domain(data = test_data, items = 10, total = "Total")

phi_d_one

phi_d_two
```

### phi_lambda

The `phi_lambda` function uses @brennan1984estimating formula to estimate the dependability of a test. One difference to note between this function and `subkoviak` is that the *cut_score* argument is expressed as a proportion.

```{r}
phi_l_one <- rcrtan::phi_lambda(test_data, 2:11, cut_score = 0.80)

phi_l_two <- phi_lambda(test_data, 10, cut_score = 0.80, total = 'Total')

phi_l_one

phi_l_two
```
