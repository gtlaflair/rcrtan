abstract={The goal for this study was to determine the ways that linguistic features form patterns of speech that are common to job interviews, and to determine how people vary in the ways that they use those patterns. The data was derived from a corpus of eighty transcripts from actual job interviews in four participating institutions in the southwest: a university, a city government, a ski resort, and a bank. The transcripts yielded 292 samples of participant talk, including the speech of both interviewers and interviewees. Methodologically, a corpus-based multifeature/multidimension approach was used, along with analysis of variance to test between-group differences in the use of the patterns. Six linguistic job interview factors were extracted and interpreted microanalytically: Informational/Involved Style, Immediate Speech/Personal Narrative, Interactional Sequence, Enthusiastic Pace/Tentative Projection, Esprit, and Personal Reference. Interviewees were found to talk more if they were older, more educated, and if they were applying for literate jobs with higher salaries. When testing group factor means for the six patterns, significant differences were found between interviewers and interviewees, men and women, literate and manual jobs, and successful and non-successful applicants. Participants used more vocabulary variety and laughter in successful interviews. Interviewers used more involved features with successful applicants, and more informational features with unsuccessful applicants. It was also shown that an interview for a literate job is constructed very differently from an interview for a manual job, calling for different linguistic skills; the productive linguistic demands on an applicant for a literate job are greater, while the receptive demands for a manual job are greater. The results underscore the importance of studying language from a multidimensional perspective. Linguistic features that had been previously assigned to single theoretical dichotomies (e.g. oral/literate, involved/detached, positively/negatively polite) were found to scatter across several functional dimensions, and to shift functions within those dimensions. The study demonstrated that it is more appropriate to see groupings of linguistic features not as dichotomies but as multidimensional patterns shifting according to both users and situations of use.},

abstract ={This study explores the construct validity of speaking tasks included in the TOEFL iBT (e.g., integrated and independent speaking tasks). Specifically, advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools, MANOVA difference statistics, and discriminant function analyses (DFA) are used to assess the degree to which and in what ways responses to these tasks differ with regard to linguistic characteristics. The findings lend support to using a variety of speaking tasks to assess speaking proficiency. Namely, with regard to linguistic differences, the findings suggest that responses to performance tasks can be accurately grouped based on whether a task is independent or integrated. The findings also suggest that although the independent tasks included in the TOEFL iBT may represent a single construct, responses to integrated tasks vary across task sub-type.},

Abstract = {A central theme throughout the impressive series of philosophical books and articles Stephen Toulmin has published since 1948 is the way in which assertions and opinions concerning all sorts of topics, brought up in everyday life or in academic research, can be rationally justified. Is there one universal system of norms, by which all sorts of arguments in all sorts of fields must be judged, or must each sort of argument be judged according to its own norms? In The Uses of Argument (1958) Toulmin sets out his views on these questions for the first time. In spite of initial criticisms from logicians and fellow philosophers, The Uses of Argument has been an enduring source of inspiration and discussion to students of argumentation from all kinds of disciplinary background for more than forty years.},
